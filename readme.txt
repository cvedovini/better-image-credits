== Description ==

This plugin adds credits and link fields to media uploads and offer several
options to display image credits on your posts and pages. You can either:

- Use the [image-credit] shortcode (optional attributes are `sep`, `before`
and `after`).
- Use the `the_image_credits()` template tag (optional parameters are `sep`,
 `before` and `after`).
- Let the plugin automatically display the credits for you, before or after the
content or overlaid above each image.

See the settings page to choose how you display the credits, including the HTML
used to build them.

This plugin is a fork of the [Image Credits plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/image-credits/)
by [Adam Capriola](http://profiles.wordpress.org/adamcapriola/). It is 100%
compatible, if you are already using the Image Credit plugin just replace it
with this one and it will work about the same way, except you will have more control.


== Installation ==

This plugin follows the [standard WordPress installation
method](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins):

1. Upload the `wp-linkedin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
